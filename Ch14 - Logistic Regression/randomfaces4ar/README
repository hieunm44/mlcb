This mat file contains random-face features for AR database. The dimension of each feature is 540.
There are three variables in this file:

(1) featureMat:
A matrix of random features. Each column correspond to one random face feature.

(2) filenameMat:
Image file names. Each cell correspond to the features from the same class in 'featureMat'. 

(3) labelMat:
